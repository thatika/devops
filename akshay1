Today's agend is too push the file without any authentication to the GitHub. 
Before giving the push command we should do some configuration as follows:
git remote -v
#with the above command we will see 2 entries in the output
git remote add mygithub git@akshaygithub:thatika/devops.git
#with this we will get 2 more entries in the git remote -v command
